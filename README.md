- **birdmalariaTL**: observations of telomere length as well as demographics and infection status of great reed warblers from Asghar et al. 2015. Science 347:436-438.
- **birdmalariaO**:  great reed warbler observations of offspring telomere length and mothers' infection status (infected with malaria or not) from Asghar et al. 2015. Science 347:436-438.
- **carppassage**: data from experimental trials aimed at blocking passage of carp in lock and dams along the Missippi River.
- **clutch**:  Mallard (*Anas platyhynchos*) clutch sizes in two types of nest structures and cropland area within a 3.2-km radius circular buffer around the nest structure in western Minnesota during 1997â€“1999.
- **CovidMN**: data on covid cases in Minnesota, downloaded on January 15, 2021
- **elephantmove**: weekly movement metrics calculated using location data from 35 African elephants between 2008 and 2015
- **fish**: data used to predict the number of fish caught by visitors of a state park.
- **gala**:   plant species richness for 29 islands in the Galapagos Islands archipelago
- **HrData**: data containing the size of wolf home ranges, extent of linear features, and primary productivity (from Dickie et al. 2022).
- **Kelp**: data from a study of the effect of various environmental factors on the shallow (upper) distributional limit of the subtidal kelp *Macrocystis pyrifera*.
- **Selake**: A fictitious (but realistic) data containing logged Selenium concentrations in a set of 9 lakes and a sample of 83 fish from these lakes. 
- **parasitoidlifespan**:  survival data collected for a parasitoid (*Aphelinus certus*) of the soybean aphid (*Aphis glycines*) over a range of host densities using a laboratory assay (from Miksanek & Heimpel, 2020).
- **longnosedace**: abundance data of longnose dace (*Rhinichthys cataractae*) and in-stream variables collected from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey.
- **nestocc**: nest occupancy data from a study of mallard nest boxes in Minnesota.
- **partialr**: simulated data set used to demonstrate added-variable and component + residual plots
- **plantherb**: data set containing information on plant-herbivore interactions
- **pines**:  data on lifespan on maximum diameter at breast height for Mountain Pines (*Pinus montana*) in Switzerland.
- **reeffish**: catch-effort data for black sea bass (*Centropristis striata*) from the Southeast Reef Fish Survey.
- **RIKZdat**: marine benthic data from nine inter-tidal areas along the Dutch coast.
- **slugs**: number of slugs found beneath 40 tiles in each of two permanent grasslands.
- **trombone**: comparison of 5 experimental practice conditions for 30 trombonists from 3 colleges.  
- **trunkfl**: data set containing measurements of trunk flare diameter and diameter at breast height for different species of trees in Minnesota cities. The data were collected for the purpose of developing predictive models to inform management planning for city streets trees with the goal of reducing sidewalk damage.
- **willowtits**: detection/non-detection and counts  of willow tits (*Poecile montanus*) during the Swiss Survey of Common Breeding Birds. 
- **WolfPackSize**: annual pack sizes associated with wolves in Montana. Data are from Sells et al. 2022.
- **youtubewages**: 35 randomly selected wages from a search of "How much do I make on YouTube" adapted from the *Skew The Script curriculum* (skewthescript.org).
