# Data4Ecologists

This package contains several data sets associated with the book, *Statistics for Ecologists*.

**Data sets:**

- **clutch**:  Mallard (*Anas platyhynchos*) clutch sizes in two types of nest structures and cropland area within a 3.2-km radius circular buffer around the nest structure in western Minnesota during 1997â€“1999.
- **beargrowth**: age and weight data from a sample of black bears monitoried in Minnesota.
- **CovidMN**: data on covid cases in Minnesota, downloaded on January 15, 2021
- **elephantmove**: weekly movement metrics calculated using location data from 35 African elephants between 2008 and 2015
- **gala**:   plant species richness for 29 islands in the Galapagos Islands archipelago
- **Kelp**: data from a study of the effect of various environmental factors on the shallow (upper) distributional limit of the subtidal kelp *Macrocystis pyrifera*.
- **Selake**: A fictitious (but realistic) data containing logged Selenium concentrations in a set of 9 lakes and a sample of 83 fish from these lakes. 
- **parasitoidlifespan**:  survival data collected for a parasitoid (*Aphelinus certus*) of the soybean aphid (*Aphis glycines*) over a range of host densities using a laboratory assay (from Miksanek & Heimpel, 2020).
- **longnosedace**: abundance data of longnose dace (*Rhinichthys cataractae*) and in-stream variables collected from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey.
- **nestocc**: nest occupancy data from a study of mallard nest boxes in Minnesota.
- **partialr**: simulated data set used to demonstrate added-variable and component + residual plots
- **pines**:  data on lifespan on maximum diameter at breast height for Mountain Pines (*Pinus montana*) in Switzerland.
- **RIKZdat**: marine benthic data from nine inter-tidal areas along the Dutch coast. Th 
- **slugs**: number of slugs found beneath 40 tiles in each of two permanent grasslands.
- **trombone**: comparison of 5 experimental practice conditions for 30 trombonists from 3 colleges.  
- **trunkfl**: data set containing measurements of trunk flare diameter and diameter at breast height for different species of trees in Minnesota cities. The data were collected for the purpose of developing predictive models to inform management planning for city streets trees with the goal of reducing sidewalk damage.
- **willowtits**: detection/non-detection and counts  of willow tits (*Poecile montanus*) during the Swiss Survey of Common Breeding Birds.
